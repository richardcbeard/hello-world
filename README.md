Getting started
Born in 1950, I was a dentist for 38 years and worked in UK, British Columbia, and the far north of Canada.  Before retiring I got a diploma in environmental restoration at UVic and now use what I learnt to restore nature as a volunteer.  I have a lifelong interest in wildlife and conservation and I want to assist others with conservation/restoration projects.
